From there, you should be able to see the TabbyMons extension pop up! 

## Updating the extension:
Whenever you make any updates to the code, all you have to do is click the tiny refresh button on the extension and it'll update it for you!

## Ideas:
- Having duplicates -> Levelling up / evolving
- Encountering with other things (items/pets/berries)
- You can only encounter rare pokemon when your pokemon have reached certain levels
- Backgrounds coinciding with pokemon type
